# Track Cannon

Speed up per-track **artist-credit resolution** in the MusicBrainz release editor.

When you add a release (especially via an import tool), each track's artist often arrives as
plain **text with no MBID**. Linking them one by one — searching, picking, occasionally
splitting `A feat. B` into two credits — is the slowest part of adding a release. Track Cannon
does the whole tracklist in one pass and lets you apply the confident matches with one click.

## How it resolves an artist

For every unresolved track it tries, in order:

1. **Sibling releases in the same release group.** Other versions of the same album usually
   contain the same songs already credited to real artists. Track Cannon pulls their per-track
   credits (with MBIDs) and matches by title — so it doesn't just *search*, it knows the
   *correct* artist. This is the highest-confidence source and resolves most VA compilations
   outright.
2. **Name search** against MusicBrainz's artist index for anything siblings don't cover.

Each suggestion is tagged **RG** (from a sibling release), **HIGH** (exact name match) or
**LOW** (best guess — review it). Multi-artist credits are matched slot-by-slot and the original
**join phrases** (`&`, `feat.`, `and`, …) and **credited-as** text are preserved.

## Usage

1. Open `…/release/add` or `…/release/<mbid>/edit`, go to the **Tracklist** tab.
2. Click **🎯 Track Cannon** (next to *Guess feat. artists from track titles*).
3. The panel matches every unresolved slot. Review the dropdowns — each is a normal artist
   picker, so you can change the choice or uncheck a row.
4. **Apply confident** links every RG/HIGH match; **Apply checked** links exactly what's ticked.
5. Anything still unmatched stays as typed text — resolve or create it the usual MB way.

Track Cannon only fills the in-page editor. **You** review and press MusicBrainz's own
*Add release* / *Enter edit* button — nothing is submitted on your behalf.

## Install

Install a userscript manager (Tampermonkey / Violentmonkey), then install the raw
`track_cannon.user.js`. Matches `musicbrainz.org` and `beta.musicbrainz.org` release add/edit pages.

## Development

```
cd userscripts/track_cannon
npm install
node test/integration.mjs          # headless end-to-end: seed → match → apply → verify
node test/integration.mjs --headed # watch it run
```

The tests drive a real logged-in MusicBrainz session via Playwright (shared `.pw-profile` at the
repo root) and seed the editor exactly the way import tools do (a flat form POST). Fixtures with
real captured release data are git-ignored (`*.local.json`) and never committed.
